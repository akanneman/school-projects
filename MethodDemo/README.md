# MethodDemo

This Java program demonstrates core method concepts including:

- Basic method creation and invocation
- Method overloading (two and three integer sums)
- Recursive functions (factorial calculation)

### Features

- `printMessage()` – prints "Hello, World!"
- `calculateSum(int, int)` – returns the sum of two integers
- `calculateSum(int, int, int)` – returns the sum of three integers (overloaded method)
- `factorial(int)` – recursively calculates the factorial of a given number

### Example Output
Hello, World!
Sum of two numbers: 12
Sum of three numbers: 30
Factorial of 5: 120
